Impact assessment involves analyzing changes in precipitation patterns, evaluating shifts in water quality parameters, assessing ecosystem disruptions, and forecasting the implications for human activities.</p>
    </div>
  
    <div class="feature">
      <h2>Predictive Modeling</h2>
      <p>Predictive modeling employs various scientific methods, statistical analysis, and computational tools to forecast changes in precipitation, temperature, sea levels, and other climatic variables. By leveraging historical data and climate scenarios, predictive models help in anticipating future trends, assessing risks, and informing policy-making for climate adaptation and mitigation strategies.</p>
      <p>These models facilitate informed decision-making for water resource planning, infrastructure development, and resource allocation, aiding in proactive measures against the potential impacts of climate change.</p>
    </div>
  
    <div class="feature">
      <h2>Sustainable Solutions</h2>
      <p>Sustainable solutions for managing water resources in the face of climate change involve a multi-faceted approach. This includes promoting water conservation practices, implementing efficient irrigation methods, fostering wastewater recycling and treatment, restoring natural ecosystems like wetlands and forests, and integrating green infrastructure.</p>
      <p>Additionally, adopting policies that encourage community participation, technological innovation, and education on sustainable water usage play a vital role. These solutions aim to enhance resilience, minimize water wastage, preserve biodiversity, and ensure equitable access to clean water for present and future generations.</p>

        <h3>Early crop yield prediction for agricultural drought monitoring using drought indices, remote sensing, and machine learning techniques</h3>
        <p class="date">Published on December 1, 2023</p>
        <p class="excerpt">The unpredictability of crop yield due to severe weather events such as drought and extreme heat continue to be a key worry. The present study evaluated six meteorological and three Landsat satellite-based vegetation drought indices from 1986 to 2019 in the drought-prone-semi-arid Saurashtra region of Gujarat (India). Cotton and groundnut crop yield prediction models were developed using multiple linear regression (multilayer perception (MLP)), artificial neural network with MLP, and random forest (RF). The models performed crop yield estimation at two timescales, i.e., 75 days after sowing and 105 days after sowing. The standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index/reconnaissance drought index among meteorological drought indices, normalized difference vegetation anomaly index/vegetation condition index, and normalized difference water index anomaly were chosen as best highest correlations with crop yields. The RF-based models were found most efficient in predicting the cotton and groundnut yield of Saurashtra with R2 ranging from 0.77 to 0.92, Nashâ€“Sutcliffe efficiency ranging from 71 to 90%, and root-mean-square error ranging from 80 to 133 kg/ha for cotton and 299 to 453 kg/ha for groundnut. This study demonstrated the method for making several decisions based on early crop yield prediction including timely drought mitigation measures.</p>

        <h3>Response of hydrological regimes to land use change: A case study of the Han River Basin </h3>
        <p class="date">Published on November 27, 2023</p>
        <p class="excerpt">Comprehensive and systematic research linking land-hydrological correlations is lacking in the study of factors driving watershed runoff variations. It quantitatively analyzes the overall watershed hydrological conditions using the range of variability approach (RVA) and applies the Budyko hypothesis to identify driving factors of annual runoff variations. The study also explores the impact of individual land use types on runoff across various timescales using the SWAT model in conjunction with historical and extreme scenarios in the Han River Basin. Results reveal that following abrupt changes, the Han River Basin experiences negative alterations in its hydrological indices and overall conditions. Among the driving factors, the lower cushion surface has the most significant impact on runoff. At an annual scale, runoff increases by 12.57 and 20.4% for cropland and construction land scenarios, while forest and grassland scenarios lead to decreases of 8.45 and 2.32%, respectively. Runoff sensitivity to land use changes is notably higher in the wet season than in the dry season at the quarterly and monthly scales. This study offers valuable insights into the integrated management of land use and water resources in the Han River Basin.</p>
